Cost about 1 month of my part time, maybe about 70 hours for me. With some former python and scheme experience, I can finish this course in a relatively shorter time than beginners. But it's still wonderful for me! Fantastic labs and projects are all well-designed.

Thanks for the huge effort all the TAs and professors put into this course!
